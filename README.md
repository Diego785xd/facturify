# Facturify

With the rise of tourism development in cultural zones of Mexico a problem arises, the lack of financial development in SMEs that leaves them at a disadvantage compared to traditional businesses that have established financial systems that enable them to easily provide billings to workers that need to visit these places. Facturify breaks these financial barriers enabling SMEs to receive a new customer market, that finds it easy to bill the company they are working for by only taking a picture of the bill and waiting for the AI to make the bill for them.
